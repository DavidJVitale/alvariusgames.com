Thanks again all who play-tested. Please continue to give me honest feedback about your experience, it can only help me. Full changelog [here](https://github.com/ludditegames/bears_on_atvs/releases/tag/v0.1.3-alpha).

I have created everything in this game -- the music, the graphics, the programming, etc -- using open source software. I use the amazing [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/), as well as GIMP, ardour, audacity, etc. Support open source software!
