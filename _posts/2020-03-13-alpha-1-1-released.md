This new version addressed much of the great feedback I received on [the previous `v0.1.0-alpha` release](/blog/bears-on-atvs/alpha-0-1-0-released.html). Thanks to all who played my game and gave me honest feedback! Major changes include a newly added tutorial level, total overhaul of the input system (4 directions, 3 different input actions), and other changes to simplify and make the game more intuitive. Read the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/ludditegames/bears_on_atvs/releases/tag/v0.1.1-alpha).

I have created everything in this game -- the music, the graphics, the programming, etc -- using open source software. I use the amazing [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/), as well as GIMP, ardour, audacity, etc. Support open source software!
