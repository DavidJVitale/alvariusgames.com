My name is David Vitale. For the past 1+ year, I have been developing a video game in my free time after work. As of today, I have created 1 complete level of this game, Bears on ATVs.

I have created everything you see above -- the music, the graphics, the programming, etc. I used the amazing [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/), as well as GIMP, Reaper, audacity, FreeSound.org, etc.

Please download this 1 level alpha and let me know what you think!
