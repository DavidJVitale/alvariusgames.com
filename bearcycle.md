## Backstory

The idea for this game came when I was hiking with friends in Alaska on a multi-use trail (we were on foot, but there were people on off-road vehicles). When hiking, we encountered two black bears about 30 feet in front of us. We followed the correct protocols and slowly backed away. While anxiously waiting for the bears to leave, I heard the faint sound of some vehicle in the distance coming towards us on the trail. In that heightened emotional state, my immediate thought was __"$#%@#, the bear commandeered a vehicle and is coming for us"__. I became infatuated with that mental image of a 500 lb beast hurling towards me at 60 mph on a metal death machine, and what the earth would look like if a fleet of these creatures took over.
